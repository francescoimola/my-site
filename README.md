## Hello! 
Thanks for dropping by. This website is where I gather my work, hobbies, and passions. It is a portfolio of past and work-in-progress projects and a greenhouse where new ideas grow. It expands my digital garden that exists across [Are.na](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/frn_imola).

I designed it with accessibility at the forefront, adopting [sustainable web design practices](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/). The open-source typeface in use is [Arimo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arimo#about) by Steve Matteson.

## Behind the scenes

This site's front-end is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It is coded in Kramdown, Markdown, HTML, CSS, and Ruby. There's only a touch of JS to make some elements do a little more.

I laid the foundations of this site on an heavily modified version of Maxime Vaillancourt's [Jekyll template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template). 

If you want to build something similar, Maxime's template is a great start. Or you can fork my version. If you have any issues getting it set up, [drop me a message](https://www.francescoimola.com/contact)! I'd be happy to help.
