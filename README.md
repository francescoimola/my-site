## What is it about? 
Hello! Thanks for dropping by. This [site](https://www.francescoimola.com/) is is a living public digital space: here I gather my work, ideas, hobbies, goals, and passions. It is a greenhouse where new ideas grow, a workshop where I create new things, and my portfolio of past and work-in-progress projects.

I built this site adopting [sustainable web design practices](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/). The open-source fonts in use are [Karrik](https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/karrik/) by Jean-Baptiste Morizot and Lucas Bihan for Velvetyne Type Foundry, and [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) by Rasmus Andersson. 

## I want to know the behind the scenes

This static site's front-end is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It is coded in Markdown, HTML, CSS, and Ruby. JS-free so far.

This repo was originally forked from Maxime Vaillancourt's [Jekyll template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) and it includes some of his plugins. However, the template has been since heavily customised.
