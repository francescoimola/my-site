## Hello! 
Thanks for dropping by. This website is where I gather my work, ideas, hobbies, goals, and passions. It is a greenhouse where new ideas grow and my portfolio of current and past projects.

I built it adopting [sustainable web design practices](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/). The open-source typeface in use is [Space Grotesk](https://fonts.floriankarsten.com/space-grotesk)</a> by Květoslav Bartoš for Florian Karsten Typefaces.

## Behind the scenes

This site's front-end is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It is coded in Kramdown, Markdown, HTML, CSS, and Ruby. There's only a touch of JS here and there to make some elements do a little more.

This repo was originally forked from Maxime Vaillancourt's [Jekyll template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) and it includes some of his plugins. However, the template has been since heavily customised and streamlined. 

If you want to build something similar, Maxime's template is a great start. Or you can fork my version. And if you have any issues getting it set up, reach out! I'd be happy to help.
