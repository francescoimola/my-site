## Hello ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for dropping by. This website is my honest window onto the world. It's written by hand using only HTML and CSS. 

It expands my digital garden that exists across [Are.na](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/). I built it with accessibility at the forefront, and adopting [sustainable web design practices](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/). The open-source typeface in use is [Arimo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arimo#about) by Steve Matteson.
