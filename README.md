### Welcome to the source code for my WIP digital garden & portfolio
This site's front-end is based on Jekyll. It is coded in Markdown, HTML, CSS, adn Ruby. JS-free so far.

The repo was originally forked from Maxime Vaillancourt's [Jekyll template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) and it includes some of his plugins. However, the original template has been since heavily customised.
