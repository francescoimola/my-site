# Welcome to the source code for my WIP digital garden & portfolio

The front-end is based on Jekyll. The rest of the site is coded in Markdown, HTML, and CSS only.

The site includes few plugins wrote by Maxime Vaillancourt for his Jekyll template, from which this repo is forked. However, it has been since heavily customised.
