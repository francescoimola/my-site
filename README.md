## Hello ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for dropping by. This website is where I gather my work, hobbies, and passions. It is a portfolio of past and work-in-progress projects and a greenhouse where new ideas grow. It expands my digital garden that exists across [Are.na](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/frn_imola).

I built it with accessibility at the forefront, and adopting [sustainable web design practices](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/). The open-source typeface in use is [Arimo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arimo#about) by Steve Matteson.

## Behind the scenes 

I designed this site by hand using only HTML and CSS. There are only five liens of minified JavaScript to make the Index filter work as intended.

If you want to build something similar, uou can fork my version. I'm hoping to turn this site into a template one day. If this idea sounds interesting, [drop me a message](https://www.francescoimola.com/contact) and it might motivate me to put work into it sooner than later.
