I (he/they) am an artist, designer, and curator based in London working with software and code to examine self-exposure on the web.

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Digital Arts from University of Greenwich, where I now work—managing social media, curating events, and designing frameworks to help students make work abiding by UK Covid-19 legislations.

Recently, I worked on a few self-initiated projects: [explore them here](/){: .internal-link}. You might also be interested in [[what's at the top of my mind]].

I have previously worked with [ONE Project London](https://one-project.co.uk/), [University of Greenwich Galleries](http://www.greenwichunigalleries.co.uk/); [TEDx Greenwich University](https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/34455), [Getintothis](https://www.getintothis.co.uk/), and other organisations.

My work has been featured on [Harbor Review](https://www.harbor-review.com/), [Fourculture](https://fourculture.com), [Emotion Wave](https://emotionwave.bandcamp.com/), [Rockit](https://www.rockit.it/) and in several physical and online exhibitions.
