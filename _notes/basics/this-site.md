title: About this site
---
Here is where I gather my work, hobbies, and passions. This site is a a portfolio of past and work-in-progress projects and a greenhouse where new ideas grow. It expands my digital garden that exists across [Are.na](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/frn_imola).

I built it considering accessibility at the forefront and adopting [sustainable web design practices](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/). The open-source typeface in use is [Arimo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arimo#about) by Steve Matteson.
