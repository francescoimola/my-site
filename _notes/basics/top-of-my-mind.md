People often ask me what I’m doing, so here's a public declaration of priorities.

* I am spending most of my time working on Marketing, Communications and Events for [University of Greenwich](https://www.gre.ac.uk/)'s Film & TV Programmes.
* <del>Worring</del> Thinking about which exhibitions I am seeing next, as soon as the UK lockdown eases and musems & galleries can reopen.
* Tranferring blog posts, essays, and other less important content from my previous Squarespace site to here.
* Learning German, slowly, using the vast amount of resources on YouTube.

### What I'm reading

* Are.na Annual 2021 – Are.na
* The Curator's Handbook - Adrian George
