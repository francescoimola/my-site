title: What's at the top of my mind
---
People often ask me what I'm doing, so here's what's on my plate.

* I just coded and designed the UX for an interactive site/listening experience hosting Magda Zoledz's sound compositions, which is featured in [OTHER-ED](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SWOHBzEUf6t3G0ehsl_wDKW9mYH2OryD/view?usp=sharing), a short series of live events led by artists.
* I am spending my weekdays juggling projects in design, marketing, communications, and events for [University of Greenwich's Film & TV Programmes](https://www.gre.ac.uk/subjects/media-arts).
* Developing my curatorial practice thanks to [Node Center](https://nodecenter.net/). Until 2022, I am part of their International Curatorial Programme, which I am thoroughly enjoying so far.
* Tending to my [Are.na channels](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/).
* <del>Worring</del> Thinking about which exhibitions to visit next, now that the UK has eased COVID restrictions. 
* Transferring blog posts, essays, and other older content from my previous Squarespace site to here.

### What I'm reading

* How to do nothing - Jenny Odell (audiobook)
* The Curator's Handbook - Adrian George
* The School of Life: An Emotional Education - Alain de Botton
* Who's Afraid of Contemporary Art? - Jessica Cerasi and Kyung An

Yes, I do read more than a book at once. I tend to keep one for every occasion. Travelling, bedtime, waiting in line: I like to be able to choose.
