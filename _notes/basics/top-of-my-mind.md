title: What's at the top of my mind
---
People often ask me what I'm doing, so here's what's on my plate:

* I recently joined [Blueberry](https://blueberrycreatives.co.uk/) as a Marketing and Communications Officer. So far, I've been spending most of my time improving and maintaining workflows to make the team more efficient and our marjeting outputs consistent. I'm also planning and co-designing a new company website and creating email and social media content.
* My time on [Node](https://nodecenter.net/)'s International Curatorial Programme is ending, and I'm now summarising my learnings in a final assignment.
* When I'm not doing the above, I'm either taking a long walk or tending to my [Are.na channels](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/).

### What I'm reading

* Are.na 2022 Annual
* The Trial by Franz Kafka

### What should I read next?

[Send me an email](mailto:hi@francescoimola.com?body=Hi%20Francesco%2C) with the title of a book you think I might like. I'm a big fan of semi-autobiographical works, but I'm open to any genre.
