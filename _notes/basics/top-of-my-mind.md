title: What's at the top of my mind
---
People often ask me what I'm doing, so here's what's on my plate and projects I recently worked on.

* I am co-curating an art trail in Hounslow, London, with [Creative People and Places](https://www.watermans.org.uk/impact/creative-people-places/). Our goal is to connect businesses (in a part of the borough) with locals, and getting everyone to experience art in unusual places. I can't wait to share more about it with you as soon as details are revealed!
* I'm open for new opportunities. I'd love to speak with you if you are progressive arts organisations, design studio, or creative collective looking for a dynamic team member. And if you have a freelance role, I'd be happy to discuss a potential collaboration.
* Until recently, I was a Programme Assistant for the University of Greenwich [Film & TV Programmes](https://www.gre.ac.uk/subjects/media-arts). 
* I recently designed a series of physical and digital elements for the 2021 [[TEDx University of Greenwich]]. In particular, I translated the event programme into a responsive website built using accessible HTML and CSS. I also designed and assisted in building stage flats and propsâ€”including a beautiful TEDx sign cut on CNC router.
* I'm currently developing my curatorial practice by taking part in [Node](https://nodecenter.net/)'s International Curatorial Programme, through which I'm building a solid understanding of the varied work of exhibition-making and cultural production. 
* When I'm not doing the above, I'm either taking the dogs for a walk, reading pre-loved books, or tending to my [Are.na channels](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/).

### What I'm reading

* The Trial by Franz Kafka

### What should I read next?

[Suggest me a book](https://forms.gle/1FXcTV855sfVKHMT9), if you wish. I'm a big fan of semi-autobiographical works, but I'm open to new discoveries.
