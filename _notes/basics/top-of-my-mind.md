title: What's at the top of my mind
---
People often ask me what I'm doing, so here's what's on my plate:

* I joined [Blueberry](https://blueberrycreatives.co.uk/) as a Marketing and Communications Officer. So far, I have spent most of my time improving and maintaining workflows to make the team more efficient and output consistent. I'm also planning and co-designing a new company website and creating email and social media content.
* My time on [Node](https://nodecenter.net/)'s International Curatorial Programme is ending, and I'm now summarising my learnings in a final assignment.
* When I'm not doing the above, I'm either taking a long walk or tending to my [Are.na channels](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/).

### What I'm reading

* Are.na 2022 Annual
* The Trial by Franz Kafka

### What should I read next?

[Suggest me a book](https://forms.gle/1FXcTV855sfVKHMT9), if you wish. I'm a big fan of semi-autobiographical works, but I'm open to any genre.
