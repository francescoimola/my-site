title: What's at the top of my mind
---
People often ask me what I'm doing, so here's what's on my plate:

* I've just been promoted to Marketing and Communications Officer at [Blueberry](https://blueberrycreatives.co.uk/). Lately, I've been spending most of my week improving and maintaining workflows to make the team more efficient and our marketing outputs consistent. I'm also co-designing a new company website and creating email and social media content.
* My time on [Node](https://nodecenter.net/)'s International Curatorial Programme is ending, and I'm now summarising my learnings in a final assignment.
* When I'm not doing the above, I'm either taking a long walk, eating falafel, tending to my [Are.na channels](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/), or practicing yoga.

### What I'm reading

* Are.na 2022 Annual
* The Trial by Franz Kafka

### What should I read or watch next

[Send me an email](mailto:hi@francescoimola.com?body=Hi%20Francesco%2C) with the title of a book/film/series you think I might like. I'm a big fan of documenatries and semi-autobiographical books, but I'm open to any genre.
