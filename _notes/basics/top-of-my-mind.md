title: What's at the top of my mind
---
People often ask me what I'm doing, so here's what's on my plate.

* I am spending my weekdays juggling projects in design, marketing, communications, and events for [University of Greenwich's Film & TV Programmes](https://www.gre.ac.uk/subjects/media-arts).
* I coded and designed the UX for an interactive site/listening experience hosting Magda Zoledz's sound compositions, which is featured in [OTHER-ED](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SWOHBzEUf6t3G0ehsl_wDKW9mYH2OryD/view?usp=sharing), a short series of live events led by artists.
* I am developing my curatorial practice with [Node Center for Curatorial Studies](https://nodecenter.net/). I am part of their 2021 cohort attending the International Curatorial Programme. I am really enjoying it so far.
* I am tending to my [Are.na channels](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/).
* Motivated by my curatorial studies, I am keeping [[Unrealised exhibitions|a log of ideas for exhibitions]] I would like to develop.
* Slowly, I will also be transferring blog posts, essays, and other older content from my previous Squarespace site to here.

### What I'm reading

I like to read multiple books at once and I tend to keep one for every occasion: travelling, bedtime, waiting in line. Here's what I'm reading now.

* The Curator's Handbook - Adrian George
* The School of Life: An Emotional Education - Alain de Botton
* Who's Afraid of Contemporary Art? - Jessica Cerasi and Kyung An
