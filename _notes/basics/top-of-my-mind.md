title: What's at the top of my mind
---
People often ask me what I'm doing, so here's what's on my plate and projects I recently worked on.

* Until recently, I was a Programme Assistant for the University of Greenwich [Film & TV Programmes](https://www.gre.ac.uk/subjects/media-arts). I'm now actively looking for new opportunities: I'd love to talk to you if you are progressive arts organisations, design studio, or creative collective looking for a dynamic team member. And if you have a freelance role, I'd be happy to discuss a potential collaboration.
* I recently designed a series of physical and digital elements for the 2021 [TEDx University of Greenwich](https://www.ted.com/tedx/events/41516). In particular, I translated the event programme into a responsive website built using accessible HTML and CSS. I also designed and assisted in building stage flats and propsâ€”including a beautiful TEDx sign cut on CNC router.
* I'm currently developing my curatorial practice by taking part in [Node](https://nodecenter.net/)'s International Curatorial Programme, through which I'm building a solid understanding of the varied work of exhibition-making and cultural production. Motivated by my curatorial studies, I'm keeping a log of [[Unrealised exhibitions|unrealised exhibitions ideas]].
* When I'm not doing the above, I'm either taking the dogs for a walk, cooking, or tending to my [Are.na channels](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/).
