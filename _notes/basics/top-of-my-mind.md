People often ask me what I’m doing, so here’s what’s on my plate.

* Spending my weekdays juggling projects in design, marketing, communications, and events for [University of Greenwich’s Film & TV Programmes](https://www.gre.ac.uk/subjects/media-arts).
* Studying and practicing curating as part of [Node Center](https://nodecenter.net/) International Curatorial Programme, which I started in June this year.
* Tending to my [Are.na channels](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/).
* <del>Worring</del> Thinking about which exhibitions to visit next, now that the UK has eased COVID restrictions.
* Transferring blog posts, essays, and other older content from my previous Squarespace site to here.
