This Twitter bot generated a new exhibition title for fictional art exhibitions everyday for two years. It was stopped in spring 2021 after successfully generating more than 500 titles. I built the bot using the [Bright Spiral editor](https://www.brightspiral.com/tracery/), which is written in [Tracery](https://tracery.io/), and [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) to automate the posting. 

This works is inspired by [another exhibition title generator](http://www.mit.edu/~ruchill/lazycurator.submit.html) built by Rebecca Uchill & Ben Guaraldi.
