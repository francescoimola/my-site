title: Feed Your Demons and Meet the Ally
---
Cross-referencing mythology, pop culture, the supernatural, digital self-hood, and neo medievalism, the works presented in this "ZIP" exhibition explore fears, desires, and obstacles artists face within themselves in times of crisis and isolation.

Feed Your Demons and Meet the Ally was curated by Magda Żołędź (of ONE Project) and Francesco Imola. The exhibition was presented on July 2, 2020, with an online opening featuring interviews, Q&As and workshops. Visit the project at https://linktr.ee/feedyourdemons
