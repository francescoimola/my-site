Half webwork half expanded poem, this work is part of an [ongoing observation](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/how-to-feel-more-at-home), exploring and articulating personal ideas of home, what (and who) makes one, and how to find meaning living in-between homes.

I built this site using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/), and [Tonal](https://github.com/tonaljs/tonal). I tested it on desktop Firefox and Chrome, and mobile iOS Chrome, and it might not work as intended on other devices/browsers
