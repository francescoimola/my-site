_In the Aisles_ is an interactive poster for, and in homage of, the homonymous [story by Clemens Meyer](https://www.thewhitereview.org/fiction/in-the-aisles/) (later adapted into the movie _In den GÃ¤ngen_). I built this site with [Twine](https://twinery.org/), an "open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories", by combining a series of elements:

Crucial to the experience are the extracts from the story, interrupted by numerous PDF to HTML exports of sketches on paper illustrating how I imagined the narrated environment. These exports created natural errors "in translation", which I deliberately included as part of the experience. The site homepage displays a GIF of a CAD model of a forklift, suggesting yet another link to the warehouse where the story takes place. Last but not least, I composed a custom soundtrack that plays looped throughout the site.
