Here are some of the works of internet art I built between 2017 and 2021. As for the case of most internet artworks out there, a few of these sites still work, while othersâ€”now deprecatedâ€”don't.

_Ray-Glow_ was built for the 18th session of [Sunday Sites](https://sundaysites.cafe/). The theme for this session was _Weather_ and the site was built using HTML and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

## gug & Looking, 2018

_Gug_ and _Looking_ are two interconnected works I created to display at the University of Greenwich 2019' exhibition for second-year students. By collecting as many examples of face-less profiles as I could, I put together a short lopping video, _Looking_, of profile pictures of Grindr users that preferred not to show their faces. _Gug_ is essentially a Grindr Username Generator. No interface, no fuss. It only generates text and emojis based on a fixed list of non-identifying names of Grindr users. 

I compiled both works manually, acquiring names and images from Grindr users in London, a choice that makes the works inarguably location-specific and time-bound. At the same time, they capture a snapshot of what being in Grindr in 2018 meant for a part of the queer community and how many users resorted to non-identifying images and names to attract potential partners. 

I contextualised these works in a short article written in 2018, which you can read [here](https://francescoimola.medium.com/we-all-want-to-be-loved-bdc88bc85d9e?sk=cde14283436d58dd984b10c41c8a5353).

## In The Aisles, 2018

_In the Aisles_ is an interactive poster for the homonymous [story by Clemens Meyer](https://www.thewhitereview.org/fiction/in-the-aisles/), which was later adapted into the movie _In den GÃ¤ngen_ (In the Aisles). I built this with [Twine](https://twinery.org/), an "open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories", by combining a series of elements. 

Crucial to the experience are the extracts from the story, interrupted by numerous PDF to HTML exports of sketches on paper illustrating how I imagined the narrated environment. These exports created natural errors "in translation", which I deliberately included as part of the experience. The site homepage displays a GIF of a CAD model of a forklift, suggesting yet another link to the warehouse where the story takes place. Last but not least, I composed a custom soundtrack that plays looped throughout the site.

An unopinionated, slider-operated double oscillators synth that functions on almost all browsers! I built this using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).
