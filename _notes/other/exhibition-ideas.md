title: Unrealised exhibition ideas
---
Here are listed some of the ideas for exhibitions I have been thinking about, but have not yet decided whether to proceed with. Feel free share any thoughts or suggestions via whichever medium you prefer. 

## Common Ground
A public exhibition that brings people to the farmer's market—and vice-versa.The market stands as an outlet to offer workshops and panels on identity and representation in rural Britain, decolonising foodways, and agriculture's contribution to tackling climate change. 

The exhibition asks:
*  How do we give strength to oppressed or marginalised people living in rural areas? 
*  And how do we embrace food and ways of cooking that resist subjugation and instead nourish our palate, body, and environment?

To develop this idea I opened [an Are.na channel](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/a-collaborative-travelling-exhibition) which contains further reference material and raw thoughts.

## Toward a Sustainable Practice
This exhibition introduces a cohort of emerging artists and designers building works that are either self-sufficient, recycled, biodegradable, low-tech or run on human power or renewable energy. At the core of this exhibition is a wish to explore—and question—critical approaches to producing, disseminating, and displaying art. It is loosely based on the 2005 exhibition and book "[Beyond Green: Toward a Sustainable Art](https://curatorsintl.org/images/uploads/BG_PD.pdf)" and inspired by a show I installed years ago, "[Art as problematic Waste](http://www.greenwichunigalleries.co.uk/artasproblematicwaste/)", which shares similar concerns.

I have thought of two contrasting ways to approach this project. A first more attainable version, and a second which eliminates all financial, time, and location-related constraints.

* The first proposal is to curate a decentralised exhibition happening within the confines of the storage space of a cargo bike, with multiple bikes transporting and displaying either one or various works each. Cargo bikes have [storage space](https://www.transportxtra.com/files/74429-l.jpg) where works can be installed or transported to then be "unfolded" on location. Cargo bikes can take many shapes and are also available electric. Each day, "exhibition bikes" will park in popular spots of the city or town and move location based on a predetermined itinerary. Visitors can follow and find the works/bikes live through a dedicated app. The exhibition will last approximately 4 weeks. During this time, there will be performances, workshops, book launches, film screenings, and talks happening alongside. The events will expand upon the works in the exhibition and will especially encourage the participation of unrepresented minorities and people living in poverty.

* Mile for mile, [flying is the most damaging way to travel for the climate](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200218-climate-change-how-to-cut-your-carbon-emissions-when-flying). So, it would make sense to bring an exhibition concerned with reduced consumption, sharing of resources, sustainability and global solidarity to the place where most people transit before, after, or between flights: the airport. In a similar way to the approach above based on bikes as modes of transport, airports too are synonyms of circulation. But while bikes are [democratic vehicles](https://www.critcity.com/blog/2020/7/19/the-bicycle-as-a-vehicle-of-democracy) that move people and goods, airports are the waiting rooms of modern life. And by contrast, an airport is also a [non-space](https://liminalnarratives.com/2017/04/22/airports/) of consumption that embodies economic globalisation. The exhibition will occur in the world's largest airport, the newly-built Beijing Daxing International Airport in China. Choosing the biggest airport in the country that produces the most carbon dioxide globally (China emits 28% of the world's CO2) as the location for this exhibition is a desire to establish a broad base for change and inspire action to counter the onslaught of our climate emergency. The exhibition will have both small and large-scale works situated in different areas of the airport. It will last for at least six months, during which time it has the potential to reach over 6 million passengers/visitors ([the airport's capacity averages around 1,340,954 per month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Daxing_International_Airport)). Participating artists will be from China, and each will receive funding to build their work for the exhibition and a follow-up grant to allow them to continue developing their practice.
