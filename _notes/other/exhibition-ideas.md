title: Unrealised exhibitions

Here are listed some of the ideas for exhibitions I have been thinking about. Most of them are only seeds, while a few I describe more in detail. Some will never be realised. Still, I find it important to share these ideas with you.

## Prendiamoci cura 
Prendiamoci cura (from Italian, meaning _let's tend_—to something or someone) is a project exploring art and creative practices associated with belonging, or feeling at home, in digital spaces by way of tending to digital gardens, gaming, cultivating interests, and being (virtually) in the proximity of others. How can these practices help build a sense of self? What does it mean to tend to a community space on the internet?

Ideally, this woudl take form as an exhibition, or series of interventions, hosted in cafes and coffe shops across _a_ borough of London and it will showcase the work of local artists and creative producers.

## Common Ground
A public exhibition that brings people to the farmer's market—and vice-versa.The market stands as an outlet to offer workshops and panels on identity and representation in rural Britain, decolonising foodways, and agriculture's contribution to tackling climate change. How do we give strength to oppressed or marginalised people living in rural areas? And how do we embrace food and ways of cooking that resist subjugation and instead nourish our palate, body, and environment?

## Toward a Sustainable Practice
This exhibition introduces a cohort of emerging artists and designers building works that are either self-sufficient, recycled, biodegradable, low-tech or run on human power or renewable energy. This project explores and questions critical approaches to producing, disseminating, and displaying art. It is loosely inspired by the 2005 exhibition and book "[Beyond Green: Toward a Sustainable Art](https://curatorsintl.org/images/uploads/BG_PD.pdf)" and a show I installed years ago, "[Art as problematic Waste](http://www.greenwichunigalleries.co.uk/artasproblematicwaste/)", which shares similar concerns.

I have thought of two ways to approach this project:

* The exhibition will happen in the storage space of a cargo bike, with multiple bikes transporting and displaying either one or a couple of works each. Cargo bikes have [fron or rear-loading "baskets"](https://www.transportxtra.com/files/74429-l.jpg) where works can be installed or transported to then be parked on location, where visitors can experience the works they carry. Each day, the exhibition bikes park in popular outdoor spots of the city/town and then move location based on a predetermined itinerary, that visitors can follow from their mobiles. Alongside the main itinerary, there are performances, workshops, book launches, film screenings, and talks. These events expand upon the works in the exhibition and especially encourage the participation of unrepresented minorities and people living in poverty.

* Mile for mile, [flying is the most damaging way to travel for the climate](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200218-climate-change-how-to-cut-your-carbon-emissions-when-flying). So, it would make sense to bring an exhibition concerned with reduced consumption, sharing of resources, sustainability and global solidarity to the airport, a [non-space](https://liminalnarratives.com/2017/04/22/airports/) of consumption that embodies economic globalisation. The exhibition occurs in a large airport, such as the newly-built Beijing Daxing International Airport in China. Hosting the exhibition in a mega airport comes from a desire to establish the broadest base for change. Participating artists will receive funding to build and install their work and a follow-up grant to allow them to continue developing their practice.
