In a time where offline life has become so intertwined with the online, how are artists and curators responding to digital culture?

_Everything You See Is In The Past_ is a curatorial research project and exhibition exploring the impact of the internet and contemporary digital culture on the practice of artist-curators. The project began in September 2019 and culminated in May 2020 with an exhibition and accompanying catalogue.
