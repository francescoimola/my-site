A curatorial research project and exhibition exploring the impact of the internet and contemporary digital culture on the practice of artist-curators. 

The project began in September 2019 and culminated in May 2020 with an exhibition—opened with a virtual tour—and accompanying catalogue. The exhibition featured works from Enes Alba, Atom Chen, Dario Bucheli, and Perce Jerrom. And the catalogue included interviews and Q&As with Lisa Barnard, Pita Arreola-Burns, Elliott Burns, Valentina Peri, Ghislaine Boddington, and Walter Corneli. I also wrote an in-depth [examination of the curatorial process](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/eysiitp-project-portfolio-francesco-imola), with which I graduated in Digital Arts from the University of Greenwich in 2020.

The name for this project pays homage to a homonimous [work](http://www.everythingyouseeisinthepast.com/) and [exhibition](http://www.postmastersart.com/archive/rozendaal13/rozendaal13.html) by artist Rafaël Rozendaal.
