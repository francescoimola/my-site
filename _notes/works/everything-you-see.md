A curatorial research project and exhibition exploring the impact of the internet and contemporary digital culture on the practice of artist-curators. 

The project began in September 2019 and culminated in May 2020 with an exhibition and accompanying catalogue featuring works from Enes Alba, Atom Chen, Dario Bucheli, and Perce Jerrom, and interviews with Lisa Barnard, Pita Arreola-Burns and Elliott Burns, Valentina Peri, Ghislaine Boddington, and Walter Corneli. I also wrote an in-depth [examination of the curatorial process](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/eysiitp-project-portfolio-francesco-imola).
