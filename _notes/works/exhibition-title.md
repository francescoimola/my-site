This Twitter bot generated a new exhibition title for a fictional art exhibition every day for two years. It stopped posting in spring 2021 after successfully writing more than 500 titles. I built the bot using the [Bright Spiral editor](https://www.brightspiral.com/tracery/) and [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) to automate the posting.

This work is inspired by [another exhibition title generator](http://www.mit.edu/~ruchill/lazycurator.submit.html) built by Rebecca Uchill & Ben Guaraldi.
