Exhibition Title Bot is an autonomous program that generated a new exhibition title for a fictional art exhibition every day for two years between 2018 and 2021. It stopped posting after writing and posting over 500 titles, from the hilarious to the most grotesque.

I built the bot using the [Bright Spiral editor](https://www.brightspiral.com/tracery/) and [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/) to automate the posting. This work is inspired by [another exhibition title generator](http://www.mit.edu/~ruchill/lazycurator.submit.html) built by Rebecca Uchill & Ben Guaraldi.
