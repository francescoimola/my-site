title: Exhibition Title Bot
description: An autonomous bot generated a new exhibition title for a fictional art exhibition every day for two years between 2018 and 2021.
---
The "Exhibition Title Bot" is an autonomous program that generated and tweeted over 500 exhibition titles for fictional art exhibitions, from the hilarious to the grotesque. It tweeted every day for two years between 2018 and 2021.

I built it using [Bright Spiral](https://www.brightspiral.com/tracery/) and [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/). This work is inspired by [another exhibition title generator](http://www.mit.edu/~ruchill/lazycurator.submit.html) by Rebecca Uchill & Ben Guaraldi.
