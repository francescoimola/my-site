The "Exhibition Title Bot" is an autonomous program that generated and posted on Twitter a new exhibition title for a fictional art exhibition. It run every day for two years between 2018 and 2021. And it stopped posting after generating over 500 titles, from the hilarious to the grotesque.

I built it using [Bright Spiral](https://www.brightspiral.com/tracery/) and [Cheap Bots Done Quick](https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/). This work is inspired by [another exhibition title generator](http://www.mit.edu/~ruchill/lazycurator.submit.html) by Rebecca Uchill & Ben Guaraldi.
