description: Exhibition exploring fears, desires, and obstacles artists face within themselves in times of crisis and isolation
---
Cross-referencing mythology, pop culture, the supernatural, and digital selfhood, the works presented in this ZIP-compressed exhibition explore fears, desires, and obstacles artists face within themselves in times of crisis and isolation.

Feed Your Demons and Meet the Ally is curated by Magda Żołędź—of [ONE Project](https://one-project.co.uk/)—and I. We opened the exhibition on 2nd July 2020 with an online opening featuring interviews, Q&As, and workshops with artists in the show.
