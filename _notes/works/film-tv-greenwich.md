description: Design, Copywriting, Video-Editing, Community and Social Media Management for the Film & TV Programmes at University of Greenwich
---
During the 2020-21 academic year I supported the Film & TV team at University of Greenwich. Here I designed student hubs and communications content, oversaw digital marketing at programme level, wrote articles, edited videos, and tended the community of FTV students onlineâ€”beside doing many other things.

Highlights from my time with the Film & TV Programmes include the following projects:

## Business of Film

I developed a series of videos and graphic design elements for a new asynchronous course on the business of film, soon to be offered to undergraduate students.

## Film & TV Hub and Slack Channel

I developed and implemented a major hub for all FTV undergraduate and postgraduate students (hosted on their e-learning platform) to access an array of resources on funding, producing, location-scouting, casting, shooting, and marketing for their films and TV pilots. 

I also assisted senior staff in managing the newly-opened FTV Slack workspace, including responding to queries, posting about upcoming events, and maintaining a channel where I shared links to affordable film festivals and awards for students to submit their films to.

To invite students to join the hub and the Slack workspace, I designed social media posts and internal communication images that either explained why they should look into these spaces or pointed them to either space from elsewhere on their e-learning platform.
