title: Film & TV Hub, University of Greenwich
description: Information Architecture, Community Management, and Content Design for a major hub for Film & TV students at the University of Greenwich.
---

I developed and implemented a central hub for all FTV undergraduate and postgraduate students (hosted on their e-learning platform) to access an array of resources on funding, producing, location-scouting, casting, shooting, and marketing for their films and TV pilots. 

I also supported senior staff in managing a newly-opened FTV Slack workspace, including responding to queries, posting about upcoming events, and maintaining a channel where I shared links to affordable film festivals and awards for students to submit their films. 

To invite students to join the hub and the Slack workspace, I designed social media posts and internal communication images that described why students should look into these spaces or pointed them to either space from elsewhere on their e-learning platform.
