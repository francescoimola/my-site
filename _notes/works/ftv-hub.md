title: Film & TV Hub, University of Greenwich
description: Information Architecture, Community Management, and Content Design for a major hub for Film & TV students at the University of Greenwich.

I developed and implemented a central hub for all Film & TV students at the University of Greenwich. Hosted on their e-learning platform, the Hub gives access to an array of resources on funding, producing, location-scouting, casting, shooting, and marketing to help students create and distribute their films and TV pilots. 

WHile building the Hub, I also supported senior staff on the Film & TV Programmes in managing a newly-opened community space on Slack, where I maintained a channel in which I shared links to affordable film festivals and awards for students to submit their films. To invite students to join the Hub and the Slack workspace, I designed engaging social media posts and internal communication graphics.
