When I joined the Greenwich Film & TV Programmes in 2020, the teaching team needed an accessible, reliable, and easy to maintain digital space for students to find information on creating and distributing their audiovisual work. The growing impact of the pandemic on education heightened the need for a centralised platform that would ease the workload for management, lecturers, and students.

So over six months, I developed and implemented a central hub for all Film & TV students. The Hub gives access to resources on funding, producing, location-scouting, casting, shooting, and marketing to guide students to create and distribute their films and TV pilots. It also provides detailed guidelines for shooting during Covid, which I assembled with the help of industry specialists.

While building the Hub, I helped manage a new community space on Slack. I then designed engaging social media posts and internal communication graphics to attract and invite students to join the Hub and the Slack workspace.
