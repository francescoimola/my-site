Between 2018 and 2020 I assisted the production, install, and documentation of over 60 art and architecture exhibitions
and events at [University of Greenwich Galleries](https://www.greenwichunigalleries.co.uk/). Here are some of the
highlights from that time, alongside the core role(s) I played in the production/delivery of each of the listed projects.
