description: Some of the projects I've worked on from my time at University of Greenwich Galleries.
---
Between 2018 and 2020 I assisted the production, design, delivery, and documentation of over 100 art, design, and architecture exhibitions & events at University of Greenwich Galleries. Here are some of the highlights from that time, alongside the core role(s) I played in the production of each project.
