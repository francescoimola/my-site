_Gug_ and _Looking_ are two interconnected works I created in 2019 and have exhibited at the University of Greenwich _Square One_ exhibition. 

By collecting as many examples of face-less profiles as I could, I put together a short lopping video, _Looking_, of profile pictures of Grindr users that preferred not to show their faces. On the other hand, _Gug_ is essentially a Grindr Username Generator. No interface, no fuss. It only generates text and emojis based on a fixed list of non-identifying names of Grindr users. 

I compiled both works manually, acquiring names and images from Grindr users in London‚Äîa choice that makes the works inarguably location-specific and time-bound. However, if not universal, these works captured a snapshot of what being in Grindr in 2018 meant for a part of the queer community. And they underline the number of people that resorted to using non-identifying profile pictures to hide their identity. And "hot" epigrammatic names to attract potential partners.

I contextualised these works in a short article written in 2019, which you can read [here](https://francescoimola.medium.com/we-all-want-to-be-loved-bdc88bc85d9e?sk=cde14283436d58dd984b10c41c8a5353).
