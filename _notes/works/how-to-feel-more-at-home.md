    This website incorporates an expanded poem, a series of mobile photograps, and interactive semi-generative audiovisual elements into a singular landing page. This work was born out of a desire to explore and articulate personal ideas of home, what (and who) makes one, and how to find meaning living in-between homes. It is inspired and expanded by an <a href="https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/how-to-feel-more-at-home" target="_blank">Are.na channel</a> by the same title that I started in 2020.

I built this site using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/), and [Tonal](https://github.com/tonaljs/tonal). It was tested on desktop Firefox and Chrome, and mobile iOS Chrome. It might not work as intended on other devices or browsers
