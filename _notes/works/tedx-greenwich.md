For the 2021 iteration of the TEDx University of Greenwich: _Journeys_, I collaborated with a small team of filmmakers, producers, and theatre experts to design and produce green-screens (stage flats) and a stage sign. These elements were central to the set design and served to filmmakers, who implemented virtual production techniques to film the eventâ€”in a way that had never been done before for a TEDx talk.

External contractors fabricated the screens while I produced the TEDx sign using a CNC router, beautiful theatre paints, lots of patience, and the invaluable help of Greenwich technicians.

For _Journeys_ I also translated the programme of talks into a responsive and highly-accessible [website](https://journeys-tedx.glitch.me/) for the event attendees to stay informed of speakers, topics, and times. I followed TEDx branding while bringing the site's visual language close to that of the University of Greenwich. I made it as lightweight as possible (internet signal in the venue is scarce, so I kept the site under 6KB) and built it so that it is accessible from any device and to all users.
