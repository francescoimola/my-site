description: A curatorial project and exhibition exploring the impact of the internet and contemporary digital culture on the practice of artist-curators.

For the 2021 iteration of the TEDx University of Greenwich: _Journeys_, I collaborated with a small team of filmmakers, producers, and theatre experts to design stage flats and a stage sign. External contractors fabricated the stage flats while I produced the TEDx sign using a CNC router, Flints theatre paints, lots of patience, and the help of staff at the Greenwich Stockwell Street workshop.

I also translated the programme of talks into a responsive and highly-accessible website for the event attendees to stay informed of speakers, topics, and times. I followed TEDx visual language and branding, and ensured the site was lightweight (internet signal in the venue is scarce, so I kept the site under 6KB) and accessible from any device and to all users.
