"In the Aisles" is an interactive non-linear experience built around and in homage to the homonymous [story by Clemens Meyer](https://www.thewhitereview.org/fiction/in-the-aisles/) (later adapted into the movie "In den GÃ¤ngen"). I built this site with [Twine](https://twinery.org/), an open-source tool for telling non-linear stories by combining several elements. 

Crucial to the experience are the extracts from the story, interrupted by numerous PDF to HTML exports of sketches on paper illustrating how I imagined the narrated environment. These exports generated natural errors "in translation" that I deliberately included as part of the experience. In addition, the site's homepage displays a GIF of a CAD model of a forklift being spun in space, suggesting yet another link to the warehouse where the story takes place. The soundtrack you hear looped throughout the site is a piece of music I composed in response to the original story.
