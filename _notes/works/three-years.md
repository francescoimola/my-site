title: Three Years
description: Over a thousand tweets from my old Twitter account compiled in a book, installed in an exhibition, and read in person uninterruptedly.  
---

In 2019, I downloaded my entire Twitter archive of over a thousand tweets from my (old, now closed) account spanning nearly three years. I used this dataset to write a book, install it in an exhibition, and perform an uninterrupted 2:30 hrs live reading. As a believer in the power of journaling, I was interested in how presenting data as a stream of consciousness could tell the story of how it came to be published on social media.    

"Three Years" was launched and read live on 23 March 2019 at the Heritage Gallery of the University of Greenwich Galleries. It was displayed as part of [528](http://www.greenwichunigalleries.co.uk/fivetoeight/), a group show I co-curated with fellow students at the University of Greenwich.

I built a custom "single-bookshelf" from a wooden pole in which the book is slotted in to display the book. I installed this on a plinth I customised for the show. Designing "Three Years" was my first attempt at book design. Since then, I have created several more physical designs, including posters, booklets, signage, and [[Everything You See Is In The Past|exhibition catalogues]].
