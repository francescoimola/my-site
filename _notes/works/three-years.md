In 2019, I downloaded my entire Twitter archive of over a thousand tweets spanning nearly three years. I used this vast amount of data to create a book, install it in an exhibition, and perform an uninterrupted 2:30 hrs live reading. As a believer in the power of journaling, I was interested in how presenting data as a stream of consciousness could tell the story of where it came from and the person (me) behind the tweets. Plus, Twitter made it so easy to download your data that I could not resist playing with it. 

Materialising the new media into old media, I wrote a book called Three Years containing the thousands of tweets I had published in the three years before the book was assembled. Or maybe the book wrote itself, becoming a testament to the performativity of the archive.

Three Years was launched—and read—on 23 March 2019 at the Heritage Gallery (of University of Greenwich Galleries). And it was displayed as part of [528](http://www.greenwichunigalleries.co.uk/fivetoeight/), the group show I co-curated with my other exceptional students at the University of Greenwich.

### A few technical bits

* To display the book, I handmade a custom single-bookshelf from a wooden pole and installed it on a plinth. You can see a glimpse of it in the image below.
* I designed the book from scratch, and it was my first attempt at book design. I am still incredibly proud of what I have achieved making full use of the limited skills I had at the time. Since then, I have gone to create plenty more physical designs, including numerous posters, booklets, signage, and an [[Everything You See Is In The Past|exhibition catalogue]].
