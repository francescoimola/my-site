In 2019, I downloaded my entire Twitter archive of over a thousand tweets spanning nearly three years. I used this dataset to create a book, install it in an exhibition, and perform an uninterrupted 2:30 hrs live reading. As a believer in the power of journaling, I was interested in how presenting data as a stream of consciousness could tell the story of how it came to be published on social media.  

Materialising the new media into old media, I wrote a book called Three Years—or maybe the book wrote itself—containing the thousands of tweets I had published in the three years before the book was assembled. 

Three Years was launched and read live on 23 March 2019 at Heritage Gallery, University of Greenwich Galleries. It was displayed as part of [528](http://www.greenwichunigalleries.co.uk/fivetoeight/), a group show I co-curated with fellow students at the University of Greenwich.

* Designing _Three Years_ was my first attempt at book design. Since then, I have created several more physical designs, including posters, booklets, signage, and [[Everything You See Is In The Past|exhibition catalogues]].
