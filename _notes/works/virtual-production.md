title: "Virtual Production: How to Be Good"
description: Digital Marketing and Content Design for a practice-based research project on Virtual Production at the University of Greenwich.
---

I co-curated a social media campaign, shot photographs, and created content sharing the outputs of a research project on Virtual Production, titled "How to Be Good", intending to raise awareness of the importance of Virtual Production in the future of the screen industries. The film shoot at the basis of this project ran for four days and I was its resident BTS photographer. The campaign helped colleagues on the teaching team secure a deal for a book introducing Virtual production techniques and frameworks to filmmakers, including FTV students.
