title: Your first seed
---

This is your first note. You'll find it in the [`notes/`](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template/tree/master/_notes) directory.

### Link syntax

To link to another note, you can use multiple syntaxes. The following four use the "double-bracket" notation ([view the Markdown source file](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template/blob/master/_notes/your-first-note.md#link-syntax) to see the underlying syntax).

- Using the note title: [[a note about cats]]
- Using the note's filename: [[cats]]
- Using the note's title, with a label: [[A note about cats|link to the note about cats using the note title]]
- Using the note's filename, with a label: [[cats|link to the note about cats using the note's filename]]

In all cases, if the double-bracket link does not point to a valid note, the double brackets will still be shown, like this: [[there is no note that matches this link]].

Alternatively, you can use regular [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) for links, with a relative link to the other note, like this: [this is a Markdown link to the note about cats](/cats){: .internal-link}. Don't forget to use the `.internal-link` class to make sure the link is styled as an internal link (without the little arrow).

Since the Web is all about HTML, you can always use plain HTML if you want, like this: <a class="internal-link" href="/cats">This is a link to the note about cats with HTML</a>.

Of course, you can also link to external websites, like this: [this is a link to Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/). Again, you can use plain HTML if you prefer.

### Automatic bi-directional links

Notice in the "Notes mentioning this note" section that there is another note linking to this note. This is a bi-directional link, and those are automatically created when you create links to other notes.

### Link previews

If you're on a device with mouse support, try hovering your mouse on internal links to preview the notes: [[a note about cats]].

### Images and other Markdown goodies

Finally, because you have the full power of Markdown in this template, you can use regular Markdown syntax for various formatting options.

Lists work as expected:

- List element A
- List element B
- List element C

1. List element
2. List element
3. List element

So do code blocks, with full syntax highlighting:

<pre><code>// Here's a bit of JavaScript:
console.log('hello!')
</code></pre>

If you'd like to quote other people, consider using quote blocks:

> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

And of course, images look great:

<img src="/assets/image.jpg"/>
