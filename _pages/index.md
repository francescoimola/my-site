[[What's at the top of my mind|Welcome]]&nbsp;&#128075;&nbsp;I'm Francesco, a cultural producer and designer.

I develop exhibitions, events, and interactive experiences employing critical approaches to producing and disseminating art and culture. When I'm not invested in that, you can find me supporting the community of Film & TV students at University of Greenwich, from where I graduated in Digital Arts. Of late, I worked on a few self-initiated and collaborative projects, including tending to several [are.na channels](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm), coding [a listening experience](https://magdalenazoledz.com/ROOM-101), and writing an [[How to feel more at home|interactive poem]].
