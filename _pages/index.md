I am an artist, designer, curator, and event programmer based in London. This site is a living public digital space: here I gather my work, ideas, hobbies, goals, and passions. 

While the majority of this site is made up of notes, they are not its entirety. This is a greenhouse where new ideas grow, a workshop where I create new things, and my portfolio of past and WIP projects.

For now, there's no index or navigational aid: youâ€™ll need to follow a link to some starting point. <span class=".nobr">[[now|Welcome]] &#128075;</span>
