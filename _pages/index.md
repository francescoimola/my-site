# Hello there! I'm Francesco 

I'm an artist, designer, and curator based in London. This site is a living public digital space. Here I gather my work, ideas, hobbies, goals, and passions. Not exactly a portfolio, and neither a blog, but more a space for learning in public. [[Your first seed|Welcome]]
