I am an artist, designer, curator, and event programmer based in London.

    <summary><h2>Where am I</h2></summary>
    <p>This site is a living public digital space: here I gather my work, ideas, hobbies, goals, and passions. While the majority of this site is made up of notes, they are not its entirety. This is a greenhouse where new ideas grow, a workshop where I create new things, and my portfolio of past and WIP projects.</p>
    <p>For now, there's no index or navigational aid: youâ€™ll need to follow a link to some starting point. <span class=".nobr">[[What's at the top of my mind|Welcome]] &#128075;</span></p>
