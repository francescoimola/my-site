[[What's at the top of my mind|Welcome]]&nbsp;&#128075;&nbsp;I'm Francesco, a cultural producer, artist, and designer.

I develop exhibitions, events, and interactive experiences that employ standout, low-impact approaches to producing and disseminating art and culture. I'm a digital arts graduate and a curator-in-training with a thing for post-digital aesthetics. Of late, I also worked on a few collaborative and self-initiated projects, including tending to several [are.na channels](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm), coding [a listening experience](https://magdalenazoledz.com/ROOM-101), and writing an [[How to feel more at home|interactive poem]].
