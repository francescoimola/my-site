description: I'm Francesco, a cultural producer, artist, and designer

[[What's at the top of my mind|Welcome]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&#128075;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Francesco, a cultural producer, artist, and designer.

I recently finished my digital arts degree at University of Greenwich, London, where I now work in the Film and TV department. Of late, I also worked on a few self-initiated projects, including tending to several [are.na channels](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm), coding [an online listening experience](https://magdalenazoledz.com/ROOM-101), writing an [[How to feel more at home|expanded poem and site]] articulating personal ideas of home, and curating a [[Feed Your Demons and Meet the Ally|show]] exploring desires and obstacles faced by artists in isolation.
