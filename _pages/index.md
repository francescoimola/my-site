[[What's at the top of my mind|Welcome]] &#128075; I'm Francesco, an artist, creative technologist, designer, and curator-in-training. I recently finished my digital arts degree at University of Greenwich, where I now organise educational and community-building events, design multimedia content, write, and co-design frameworks to help film students make work during Covid-19.

Recently, I also worked on a few self-initiated projects. Among them a [[How to feel more at home|webwork]] articulating personal ideas of home, a [[Feed Your Demons and Meet the Ally|show]] exploring desires and obstacles faced by artists in isolation, and several [digital collections](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm).
