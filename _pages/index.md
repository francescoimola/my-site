[[What's at the top of my mind|Welcome]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&#128075;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm Francesco, an artist, cultural producer, designer, and curator-in-training. 

I recently finished my digital arts degree at University of Greenwich, where I now work on the Film and TV programmes. Of late, I also worked on a few self-initiated projects, including writing an [[How to feel more at home|expanded poem and website]] articulating personal ideas of home, curating a [[Feed Your Demons and Meet the Ally|show]] exploring desires
 and obstacles faced by artists in isolation, and tending to several [are.na channels](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm).
