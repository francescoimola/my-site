description: I'm Francesco, a cultural producer and designer

[[What's at the top of my mind|Welcome]]&nbsp;&#128075;&nbsp;I'm Francesco, a cultural producer and designer.

I develop exhibitions, curate events, and design interactive experiences employing critical approaches to producing and disseminating art and culture. I also support the student community at the School of Design of University of Greenwich, London, from where I recently graduated in digital arts. Of late, I worked on a few self-initiated projects, including tending to several [are.na channels](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm), coding [a listening experience](https://magdalenazoledz.com/ROOM-101), and writing an [[How to feel more at home|expanded poem and site]] articulating personal ideas of home.
