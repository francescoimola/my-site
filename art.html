				An interactive non-linear experience built around to the homonymous <a
				href="https://www.thewhitereview.org/fiction/in-the-aisles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">story
			by Clemens Meyer</a>. The experience guides you through extracts from the
			story, interrupted by numerous sketches on paper (taken from corrupted PDF to HTML exports) illustrating how
			I imagined the narrated environment. The homepage displays a CAD model of a forklift being spun in spaceâ€”a
			link to the warehouse where the story takes place. The soundtrack playing throughout the site is a piece of
			music I composed in response to the story.
