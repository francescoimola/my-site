          Hey, it&#39;s Francesco. Here with what I can only describe as a
          public offer of collaboration - something along the lines of raising
          my hand in the school canteen and asking if anyone wants me to play in
          their band.

            very rewarding journey so far. In my freelance work, I use design,
            words, and strategy to get people to buy stuff from other people
            (small businesses and freelancers). Or else book their time. At the
            very least, engage in their work.

            While I’m more about off-grid marketing than doing your social media
            (I know some great folks who can help with that), I can make sure
            your foundations are strong, your community is up to date, and
            you&#39;re attracting leads even in your sleep.

            at University of Greenwich with everything from events to
            copywriting, operations, design, and project management. It feels
            unreal that I’ve worked alongside so many brilliant creative people,
            from whom I&#39;ve learned literally everything I know.
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <h3 id="what-i-m-good-at">What I’m good at</h3>
          <p>
            I excel in generalist (or multidisciplinary) work with more or less
            identifiable creative components. I&#39;m always happy to help with
            ops, web and project design, tool integration, inbound marketing,
            and UX writing. Thanks to my background, I&#39;m pretty handy at
            helping small teams get tricky (read: time-consuming) projects done
            quickly and well. I&#39;m also good at tapping into simple but
            effective storytelling, design, and comms to reach clients&#39;
            goals. The best part? It&#39;s fulfilling work, and I rarely get
            bored.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I&#39;ve also had a great time working stints in
            internal comms! I enjoyed the freedom to experiment creatively and
            connect with communities both online and off. If the perfect
            internal comms role came along, I&#39;d definitely consider it.

          <h3 id="where-i-see-myself">Where I see myself</h3>
          <p>
            In between all of this, I have some extra spare time now. And
            I&#39;m open to collaborating with like-minded folks on both serious
            and silly work. In exchange for what, how long for, and how often
            will be up for negotiation depending on what the role entails.
          </p>
          <p>Some things that are not up for negotiation:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Trust.</b> In the process, that I do what I said I&#39;ll do,
              that I can ask for help when I need help, that I&#39;m not in it
              to steal your job, that I&#39;m being honest, that more often than
              not I can recognize my own mistakes, and that I can pivot if I
              need to.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Partnership.</b> Collaboration should feel like a partnership
              that evolves. That means I need to get a sense of the bigger
              picture, where I can help, and which skills I need to contribute.
            </li>
          </ul>

            <li>I&#39;m open to part-time roles</li>
