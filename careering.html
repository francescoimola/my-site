                  While I’m more about off-grid marketing than doing your social
                  media (I know some great marketers who can help with that), I
                  can make sure your foundations are strong, your community is
                  up to date, and you're attracting leads even in your sleep.

                  My forte is doing generalist (or interdisciplinary) work with
                  more or less identifiable creative components. Always happy to
                  lend a hand with ops, web and project design, tool

                  I'm pretty handy at helping small teams get tricky and
                  time-consuming projects done quickly and well. I'm good at
                  tapping into simple AND effective storytelling (through design
                  and comms) to reach clients' goals. The best part? It's
                  fulfilling work, and I rarely get bored.

                  Over the years, I've had a great time working stints in
                  internal comms too. I enjoyed the freedom to experiment
                  creatively and connect with tight-knit communities both online
                  and off. If the perfect internal comms role came along, I'd
                  definitely consider it.
