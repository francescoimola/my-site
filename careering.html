          Hey, it&#39;s Francesco. Here with what I can only describe as a
          public offer of collaboration—something along the lines of raising
          my hand in the school canteen and asking if anyone wants me to play in
          their band.

            very rewarding journey so far. I now use design,
            words, and strategy to get people to buy stuff from other people
            (small businesses and freelancers). Or else book their time. At the
            very least, engage in their work.

            While I’m more about off-grid marketing than doing your social media
            (I know some great marketers who can help with that), I can make sure
            your foundations are strong, your community is up to date, and
            you&#39;re attracting leads even in your sleep.

            at the University of Greenwich with everything from events to
            copywriting, operations, design, and project management. It feels
            unreal to have worked alongside so many brilliant people,
            from whom I&#39;ve learned literally everything I know.

          <h3 id="what-i-m-good-at">What I’m good at</h3>
          <p>
            My forte is doing generalist (or interdisciplinary) work with more or less
            identifiable creative components. Always happy to lend a hand with
            ops, web and project design, tool integration, inbound marketing,
            and UX writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&#39;m pretty handy at helping small teams
            get tricky and time-consuming projects done quickly and well.
            I&#39;m good at tapping into simple AND effective storytelling (trough design and comms) to reach clients&#39; goals. The best part?
            It&#39;s fulfilling work, and I rarely get bored.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I&#39;ve had a great time working stints in
            internal comms too. I enjoyed the freedom to experiment creatively and
            connect with tight-knit communities both online and off. If the perfect
            internal comms role came along, I&#39;d definitely consider it.

            In between all of this, I have some extra spare time now. And
            I&#39;m open to collaborating with like-minded folks on both serious
            and silly work. In exchange for what, how long for, and how often
            will be up for negotiation depending on what the role entails.

              <b>Trust.</b> In the process, that I'll do what I said I&#39;ll do,
              that I can ask for help when I need help, that I&#39;m not in it
              to steal your job or waste your time, that I&#39;m being honest, that more often than
              not I can recognize my own mistakes, and that I want us both to

              <b>Learning drives me.</b> It&#39;s the reason I get up in the
              morning, push myself, see what I can do, where those roads I
              never crossed will lead me, and what new stuff I can learn.
