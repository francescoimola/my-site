        <h2>Artists featured in "Feed Your Demons and Meet the Ally"</h2>
        <h3 id="fiorella-angelini">Fiorella Angelini</h3>
        <p>Fiorella Angelini is a Chilean artist currently studying an MFA in Media at Slade School of Art (UCL). She
            studied a
            Bachelor in Fine Art (2012) and Bachelor in Pedagogy (2013) at Finis Terrae University in Santiago, Chile.
            Fiorella
            has exhibited in Santiago at Museo de Arte Contemporáneo MAC (Museum of Contemporary Art), Museo Nacional de
            Bellas
            Artes (National Museum of Fine Arts), Museo de Artes Visuales MAVI (Visual Arts Museum), Centro Cultural de
            España
            Chile (Spanish Cultural Centre), in New York at the Local Project Art Space &amp; The Local NYC; in Mergozzo
            (Italy)
            at Casa Della Capra; in London at the Slade Research Centre UCL, Framers Gallery, and Barbican Arts Group
            Trust.</p>
        <h3 id="sandra-ara-jo">Sandra Araújo</h3>
        <p>Sandra Araújo is a non-binary and genderqueer digital artist who spends endless hours shooting at monsters
            and
            strolling through mazes. It only feels natural for these creatures to evolve through an experimental and
            explorative
            process of gamifying visual culture and popular gif files. In addition, her practice feeds on social media
            platforms
            to engage the animations into the depths of gameplay plots as if they still play old school video games.</p>
        <h3 id="ruofan-chen">Ruofan Chen</h3>
        <p>Ruofan Chen is a London-based artist working in installation, sculpture, painting, and drawing. Her work
            criticises
            the excessive use of screens and the error of information in modern society. While trying to create
            emotional
            connections with nature, her work evokes sensibility in an over-digital and mechanical community. Selected
            exhibitions include: “Social Distance” at The Royal @RSOAA in New York, USA (2020), “Beyond the Fence” at
            Wells
            Projects, London, UK (2020), “Counter Point” at Courtyard Gallery RCA, London, UK (2020), “Dream” at
            Grapevine,
            London, UK (2020), “Tumbleweed&amp; Walking People” at No Space, London (2020). Ruofan’s work is held in the
            China
            Health &amp; Medical Development Foundation; Tsinghua Holdings AI Industrial Foundation, China; China
            Academy of
            Art, China.</p>
        <h3 id="simone-d-angelo">Simone D’Angelo</h3>
        <p>Simone D’Angelo, born in 1978, is a documentary photographer. He attended Massimo Mastrorillo’s Luz Academy
            Masterclass in Rome with the collectives CESURA and Discipula. With “I must have been blind” and
            “Santabarbara”, two
            projects about his birthplace, Simone was awarded the Leica Talent, Premio Tabò, Umbria Photo Fest and was
            among the
            finalists of the Portfolio Italia 2018 prize. He has exhibited in festivals, including Fotoleggendo (Rome)
            and
            Riaperture (Ferrara). Simone is a Visual Design graduate from the European Institute of Design. In his
            long-term
            photography projects, Simone looks for a personal vision, investigating the thin line between reality and
            fiction.

        <h3 id="rikardo-dru-ki-">Rikardo Druškić</h3>
        <p>Rikardo Druškić was born in 1990 in Zagreb and has spent his adult life living in Sarajevo. His works have
            been
            exhibited independently and in collective exhibitions in art galleries and public spaces worldwide,
            including
            Sarajevo, Mostar, New York, Miami, Los Angeles, Dubai, Taiwan, Berlin, Brussels, and Vienna. He was one of
            the
            finalists in Taipei’s Art Revolution Competition in 2014. In the same year, his works “Madness Continuous”
            and
            “Depth” were selected by the visual art platform see.mee to be presented in Times Square, New York. His
            first solo
            exhibition, “Tales of Love”, took place at the Gallery Boris Smoke in 2014 in Sarajevo. The same show was
            presented
            at the Memorial Home of Svetozar Corovic in Mostar. His highlight exhibitions include “Initiation”
            (Collegium
            Artisticum, Sarajevo), “The Wall” (Historical Museum, Sarajevo), “Post-election Trauma” (Sarajevo), “Where
            is the
            Exit” (Gallery JAVA, Sarajevo), and “Diggin” (Maineouevre, Berlin). In addition, Rikardo creates
            illustrations for
            books, and he was one of the key participants of the first Festival of Street Art (FUU) in Sarajevo. In 2016
            he was
            invited to paint a mural inside the Sarajevo Youth Theater, expanding his field of interest into the world
            of public
            art. The next step in Rikardo’s career was his first video exhibition, “Children Joy,” in Sarajevo,
            projected on a
            1000m2 screen. The exhibition “Suscitans Conscientia”, held in the City Hall of Sarajevo, marks the
            beginning of his
            new artistic expression and plans for two recent shows in Brussels and Vienna. In 2019 he painted a mural in
            Brussels and, in 2020, started a residency at Almuñécar, Spain.</p>
        <h3 id="aitan-ebrahimoff">Aitan Ebrahimoff</h3>
        <p>Aitan Ebrahimoff is an artist and director based in London. His experimental shorts and TV spots sustain a
            video
            practice dictated by ideas over execution. With a background in anthropology, his work blurs the line
            between
            reality and fiction. The narrative is built through staged interaction, scripting and absurd accidents.
            Upcoming
            exhibitions include Palace International 2020, London Experimental Film Festival &amp; Berlin Experimental
            Film
            Festival. As a TV Creative, Aitan was nominated for the Best Newcomer award at PROMAX 2019. In the epicentre
            of the
            global imaging stream, he strives to do work that cuts through.</p>
        <h3 id="eduard-fadgyas">Eduard Fadgyas</h3>
        <p>Eduard Fadgyas is a London-based musician and sound designer born in Romania. He compiled the soundtrack to
            “Feed
            Your Demons and Meet the Ally”. Taking the inner demons of the mind as a starting point, Eduard imaged them
            echoing
            musical repetitions and loops ad infinitum inside the space of his brain.</p>
        <h3 id="pawe-franciszek-jasku-a">Paweł Franciszek Jaskuła</h3>
        <p>Paweł Franciszek Jaskuła was born in 1993 in Poznań Poland. Between 2015-and 2017, Pawel was studio assistant
            to
            prof. Józef Walczak. In his artistic practice, he merges philosophy, sociology and science. Since 2019 he
            has been
            part of a science and art group, Eclipse de Sol, focusing on studying solar eclipses. He is a current
            Photography MA
            student at the University of Arts in Poznań. </p>
        <h3 id="othon-g-h-">Othon G.H.</h3>
        <p>Othon G.H is an artist whose work is characterised by “the grace of decay”. Working with oil, pastel, sand
            and
            binding agent, he brings forward beauty and character from the rugged and the weather-beaten. His imagery is
            rich,
            inspired by myriads of ancient and contemporary culture. This interest in the sociological is manifested in
            the
            motives of abstract portraits and figurative and symbolic compositions. At the core of Othon’s work stands
            humankind’s existential and universal conditions and the rare mystery that life’s hardening journey brings
            forward
            without stopping.</p>
        <h3 id="jo-o-bragan-a-gil">João Bragança Gil</h3>
        <p>João Bragança Gil (Lisbon, 1989) is an artist and researcher currently based in Lisbon, Portugal. He
            graduated with
            his BA in Industrial Design in 2013 and an MA in Industrial Design in 2016. Earlier, João studied Fine Arts
            at
            Lisbon’s Academy of Fine Arts (2008-2010). He worked as a Designer for the studio KRAM/WEISSHAAR (2014) and
            several
            clients as a freelancer and as a researcher, including Camden Council (2015), the Design for Social
            Innovation Lab
            (2016), and Canon (2016-2018). João took part in a residency at the Olympic Park in Hackney in collaboration
            with
            Public Works (2015). He was a speaker at Darefest in Antwerp (2016). He has exhibited in London, Athens,
            Lisbon,
            Porto and Caldas da Rainha, including at Lisbon’s Triennale of Architecture (2013), The Institute Effect
            exhibition
            curated by Dani Admiss (2013), The Intelligent Optimist at London Design Festival curated by Ulrike Oberlak
            (2016).
            The return to his activity as an artist is marked by a robust research-based practice, in which he takes
            some of his
            experience as a designer and researcher. With a particular interest in hybrid documentary-fiction practice
            that
            functions as ambiguous and open-ended archaeology, he focuses on the effects and implications of technology.
            His
            work spans photography, video, sculpture, resurfacing of archive materials and working with found footage to
            investigate the ambiguities between history, culture, landscape, industrial processes and how technology
            shapes and
            mediates our environments. Resisting categorisation, João explores how artefacts, myths and technologies
            influence
            cycles of self-construction and deconstruction. He is currently working on Anticline, a research-based film
            on the
            problematics of the marble quarrying industry in Portugal.</p>
        <h3 id="paulina-jolla">Paulina Jolla</h3>
        <p>Paulina Jołda was born in 1995 in Wrocław, Poland. In 2019, Paulina graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts
            in
            Warsaw, where she currently lives and works. Paulina is a visual artist interested in painting, drawing, and
            site-specific installations. She points to the sociological correlation between animal species, especially
            humans,
            in opposition to others in her practice. She sees the main human drives as primal needs. Her work includes
            aspects
            like violence, greed, libido, cults, and religion. Paulina’s last project takes the form of a myth that she
            uses to
            narrate current issues. She exhibited at Art Reviews of Painting in Rzeszów (2018); Drawing Triennale in
            Katowice
            (2019); Support/Surface at the Lanzarote Art Festival (2019); Kunst-Zug in Runde Ecke in Dresden (2016).</p>
        <h3 id="gil-mac">Gil Mac</h3>
        <p>Gil Mac has signed his design projects as Whatever™ since 2006. They have been working regularly on music,
            fashion
            and theatre projects. Both as a brand and a statement, Whatever™ focuses on using brand-related
            communication tools
            and advertising to deconstruct the global consumption narrative. Inspired by the visual overload of
            corporate
            branding and advertising experienced daily worldwide, Whatever™ responds with a creative and critical
            approach. It
            subverts and re-imagines these visual elements using their exact language, thus changing the message of a
            globalised
            market and manipulating desire into an avant-garde dadaist pop deconstruction, repurposing, and reassembly
            its
            symbols. Gil is part of the New Futuristic Orchestra of Porto and a member of Lucifer’s Ensemble, a project
            that
            combines performance with sound art. It has been presented in several festivals such as Festival Forte, Art
            Attack
            Stage, Semibreve and Jardins Efémeros (where they were invited by the magazine The Wire for a talk with
            Joseph
            Stannard part of Off the Page Festival). In 2019, Whatever™ presented their show “The Wishful Fall” at the
            Serendipity festivals in Goa and Magnetic Fields in Rajasthan, India.</p>
        <h3 id="maria-sabrina-scassa">Maria Sabrina Scassa</h3>
        <p>Maria Sabrina Scassa is a London-based artist. Originally from Cordoba, Argentina, she moved to Venice,
            Italy, at 4.
            She currently studies photography at the University of the Arts London. Maria worked for Oliver Chanarin as
            an
            artist assistant and at Sadie Coles. Her practice focuses on the theme of destruction used as a
            psychological tool
            for self-analysis. Her works are created through the digital and physical manipulation of images by
            graphically
            representing her traumas through different bodily forms. Perceiving an impression as if it were a sculpture,
            her
            work considers photography’s tactile aspect and works with other materials. Her practice extends the medium
            of
            photography by pushing the image in and out of different materialities. Working in 2019 as part of the
            curatorial
            team for Taisuke Koyama and David Horvitz’s group exhibition, curation forms an integral aspect of her
            practice.
            Through collaborating with filmmaker Lucrezia Vicedomini, Sabrina’s work further includes experiments with
            moving
            imagery. “Haunted Production” is a collaborative artist-duo project based in London formed by Maria Sabrina
            (as
            Maledetta) and Lucrezia Vicedomini (as Lulu). The duo explores the universal theme of trauma and
            psychoanalytic
            theory applied to cinematic horror.</p>
        <h3 id="klara-wo-niak">Klara Woźniak</h3>
        <p>Klara Woźniak is a visual artist born in 1999 in Warsaw. Currently based in Poznan, Poland, she is a student
            of
            Photography at the University of Arts in Poznan. She graduated from the Film High School in Warsaw, Poland.
            Klara is
            interested in the materiality of photography and the borders of visual arts. Her practice deals with the
            concepts of
            memory and image violence. She works with objects, installations, photography and short videos.</p>
        <h3 id="curators">Curators</h3>
        <p>Feed Your Demons and Meet the Ally is a curatorial project and exhibition led by Magda Żołędź of ONE Project
            and
            Francesco Imola. Magdalena focuses her practice on the notion of post-photography. She works with text,
            photography,
            experimental video and object. Magda deals with the evolution of digital images in her research, often
            referring to
            posthumanism. In 2017, she started a PhD programme in photography at the University of Arts in Poznań, and
            between
            2018 and 2019, she was a visiting research student at the Slade School of Fine Art. And during that time,
            Magda
            began developing ONE project, including the idea of exhibiting a singular image in the post-photographic
            age. She is
            a member of the collective 280A.</p>
