                I wrote, performed, and recorded all songs on this EP. Mixing was a collaboration with
                Walter Corneli. The EP was mastered by Chris Pavey, and artworks were created by me. The music video
                for
                "Building 1" is titled "Hub_&_Minerals_[182]" and was directed and produced by Walter Corneli. Luca
                Rautti
                assisted the editing.
