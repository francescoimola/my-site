            I wrote, performed, and recorded all songs on this EP. Mixing was a collaboration with
            Walter Corneli. The EP was mastered by Chris Pavey, and artworks were created by me. The music video
            for
            "Building 1" is titled "Hub_&_Minerals_[182]" and was directed and produced by Walter Corneli. Luca
            Rautti
            assisted the editing.
