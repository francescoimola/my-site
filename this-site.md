title: About this site
---
Here is where I gather my work, hobbies, and passions. This site is a a portfolio of past and work-in-progress projects and a greenhouse where new ideas grow. It expands my digital garden that exists across [Are.na](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/frn_imola).

I laid the foundations of this site on an heavily modified version of Maxime Vaillancourt's [Jekyll Template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template), and I designed it with accessibility at the forefront, adopting [sustainable web design practices](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/). The open-source typeface in use is [Arimo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arimo#about) by Steve Matteson.

Like it and want to make something similar? The source code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/francescoimola/my-site) and you can [drop me a message](/contact) if you have any questions.
