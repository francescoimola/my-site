title: What's at the top of my mind
---
Here's what's on my plate:

* I have recently moved from London to Folkestone, in the south of England. I’m a 10 min walk to the sea and not far from kilometres of beautiful coastline, cliffs, parks, and nature. [Here](https://www.are.na/block/18552671) I talk more about how it felt to leave the city—spoiler: it wasn't easy, but I think I made the right decision.
* Lately, I've been spending my work week improving [Blueberry](https://blueberrycreatives.co.uk/)'s marketing workflows, creating content for their social media, and redesigning their newsletters.
* I'm part of an international group of curators and art practictioners. We're meeting monthly to discuss work, art and life. We share learning experiences and are slowly discovering common interests.
* When I'm not doing the above, I'm either taking long walks, tending to my [Are.na channels](https://www.are.na/francesco-imola-2o2ng4qooxm/), practicing yoga, bing-watching tiny-house videos, or listening to Phoebe Bridgers.

### What I'm reading

* Design as Art - Bruno Munari
* The Precipice - Toby Ord

### What should I read or watch next

[Send me an email](mailto:hi@francescoimola.com?body=Hi%20Francesco%2C) with the title of a book, film, or series you think I might like. I'm a big fan of documentaries and semi-autobiographical stuff, but I'm open to any genre.
